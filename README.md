# Sudoku

This Sudoku generator functions by first filling in an empty grid with a valid Sudoku solution, then replaces random positions with a 0 (representing a blank space) while continually checking that there is only one solution to the unfinished board. 

** written in Elm, as an exercise for functional programming.
